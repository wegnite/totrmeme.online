# TOTR Meme Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 16, 2025**

## Introduction

Welcome to TOTR Meme ("we," "us," or "our"). We operate totrmeme.online, an educational meme hub and generator that helps you understand and remix the viral TOTR/TOTЯ/Тотя trend. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information when you browse the site, subscribe to updates, or export creations from our generator.

## Information We Collect

### Account & Contact Details
- **Registration data** such as name and email when you sign up for an account or waitlist.
- **Support messages** you send through forms or email so we can respond to your request.

### Meme Creation Activity
- **Template selections and text edits** made within the generator in order to provide undo history and export files.
- **Export preferences** like format, quality, or watermark settings so the download dialog can be prepared.

### Technical & Usage Data
- **Device information** (browser, language, screen size) to optimise the canvas layout.
- **Interaction analytics** (pages visited, buttons clicked, load speed) captured in aggregate to improve content relevance.
- **Cookies** that remember language, theme and consent choices. Optional analytics cookies are only stored with your consent.

We do not store payment information because all optional upgrades are processed by third-party providers such as Stripe under their own privacy terms.

## How We Use Information

- **Provide and improve the service:** maintain your session, keep your edits in place, ship new templates, and troubleshoot bugs.
- **Communicate updates:** send release notes, meme trend alerts, or transactional emails you explicitly request.
- **Protect the platform:** detect abuse, rate-limit suspicious traffic, and comply with legal obligations.

We never sell your personal data. Any analytics we study is aggregated or de-identified.

## Legal Bases (EEA/UK Users)

Where GDPR applies, we rely on the following legal bases:
- **Contract:** delivering the generator and downloads you request.
- **Legitimate interest:** keeping the site secure, measuring product performance, and preventing misuse.
- **Consent:** storing optional analytics cookies or sending marketing emails.

## Data Retention

- **Active accounts:** kept while your account remains open.
- **Deleted accounts:** anonymised or erased within 30 days of your request.
- **Support messages:** retained up to 18 months for audit unless you ask for earlier removal.

## International Transfers

Our infrastructure may operate in the United States and European Union. Whenever data is transferred across borders we rely on standard contractual clauses or equivalent safeguards.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location you may have the right to access, correct, delete, restrict, or export your personal data, and to object to certain processing. You can exercise these rights by emailing privacy@totrmeme.online. You can also withdraw consent to optional cookies at any time via our cookie preferences banner.

## Third-Party Services

We integrate with carefully selected providers:
- **Hosting & CDN:** to deliver images and downloads quickly.
- **Analytics:** privacy-friendly tools that aggregate traffic trends.
- **Email & authentication:** only to deliver the messages or login options you opt into.

Each provider is contractually required to protect your information.

## Children

TOTR Meme is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect their personal data. If you believe a child provided information, contact us so we can delete it.

## Updates to This Policy

We may revise this Policy when we launch new features or comply with new regulations. Material updates will be announced on this page and, when appropriate, via email notifications.
