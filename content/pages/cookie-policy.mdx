# TOTR Meme Cookie Policy

**Last Updated: January 16, 2025**

## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your browser. We use them to remember your preferences, keep the meme generator running smoothly, and learn which pages people find helpful. Some cookies are essential for the site to function; others are optional and only set with your consent.

## Cookies We Use

### Essential (Required)
These cookies cannot be switched off because they power core functionality:

- **Session & authentication** – keep you logged in, remember your locale, and maintain undo history in the generator.
- **Security** – help detect unusual traffic and prevent abuse of the download endpoints.

### Functional (Optional)
Improve your creative workflow:

- **Preferences** – store theme choice (light/dark), canvas settings, and recently used templates.
- **Watermark & export options** – remember whether you last downloaded PNG or JPG so we can pre-fill the dialog.

### Analytics (Optional)

- **Performance insights** – privacy-friendly analytics that aggregate page load time, button clicks, and template popularity so we know where to optimise.
- **A/B testing** – occasional experiments to compare copy or layout. Participation is anonymous and opt-in only.

### Marketing (Optional)

Only placed when you explicitly consent. Used to measure campaign performance when you land via a newsletter or partner link. We do not run third-party ad trackers.

## Managing Cookies

- **Consent banner:** accept, reject, or customise categories the first time you visit. You can reopen the preferences panel from the footer at any time.
- **Browser controls:** clear or block cookies through your browser settings (Chrome > Settings > Privacy; Safari > Preferences > Privacy; etc.).

Blocking essential cookies may prevent the generator from working correctly, including losing access to saved edits or being asked to log in repeatedly.

## Retention

- Essential cookies last for the duration of your session or up to 30 days.
- Preference cookies remain for up to 12 months unless you clear them earlier.
- Analytics and marketing cookies expire within 13 months or sooner if you withdraw consent.

## Third Parties

We rely on trusted vendors who may set or read cookies on our behalf:

- **Cloudflare** for CDN performance and security.
- **Analytics providers** (e.g., Plausible, Umami) to aggregate site metrics.
- **Payment processors** (Stripe) if you upgrade; they manage their own cookies under separate policies.

Each partner is contractually obligated to handle data responsibly.

## Updates

We will update this policy if our cookie usage changes. Material updates will be announced via the banner and dated at the top of this page.
