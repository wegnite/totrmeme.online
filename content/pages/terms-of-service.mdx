# TOTR Meme Terms of Service

**Last Updated: January 16, 2025**

## 1. Agreement to Terms

By accessing totrmeme.online, creating an account, subscribing to our updates, or using the TOTR meme generator (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please discontinue use.

## 2. Service Description

TOTR Meme is an informational site and creative toolkit focused on the viral TOTR/TOTЯ/Тотя meme. We provide educational content, downloadable assets, and a browser-based editor for creating parody-safe memes. Unless otherwise stated, the Services are for personal and non-commercial use.

## 3. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old, or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction, to create an account. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organisation, you confirm you have authority to bind that organisation to these Terms.

## 4. Accounts & Security

- Provide accurate information when registering and keep login credentials confidential.
- You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.
- Notify us immediately at legal@totrmeme.online if you suspect unauthorised access.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or pose security risks.

## 5. Acceptable Use

When using the Services you agree **not** to:

- Upload or generate unlawful, defamatory, or infringing content.
- Misrepresent source attributions or remove our branding/watermark unless you have an applicable licence.
- Attempt to reverse engineer, interfere with, or disrupt the platform.
- Use automated tools (bots, scrapers) that overload our infrastructure.
- Bypass usage limits, rate limits, or paywalls.

We may remove content or restrict access if we believe these rules are violated.

## 6. Intellectual Property

- We own the TOTR Meme brand, website design, original templates, and software. These are protected by copyright and trademark laws.
- You retain rights to memes you create, subject to third-party rights (e.g., Nickelodeon/Viacom for SpongeBob characters). You are responsible for ensuring your use complies with applicable laws and platform policies where you publish the content.
- By submitting feedback or ideas, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use them for product improvement.

## 7. Paid Features

If we offer premium upgrades or downloads:

- Fees are billed through third-party processors such as Stripe under their own terms.
- All charges are final unless otherwise required by law. Contact support within 14 days for billing questions.
- Access may be revoked for chargebacks or fraudulent activity.

## 8. Third-Party Links

The site may reference external platforms (TikTok, YouTube, etc.). We are not responsible for their content or policies. Use external links at your own risk and comply with their terms.

## 9. Disclaimers

- The Services are provided “as is” without warranties of any kind, express or implied.
- We do not guarantee that any generated meme will avoid takedowns or earn a particular level of engagement.
- Availability may be interrupted for maintenance, feature updates, or circumstances beyond our control.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, TOTR Meme and its contributors are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill. Our total liability for any claim shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the preceding 12 months (or USD $0 if you have not purchased anything).

## 11. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless TOTR Meme from any claims arising out of your use of the Services, your content, or violation of these Terms.

## 12. Privacy

Your use of the Services is also governed by our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) and [Cookie Policy](/cookie-policy).

## 13. Changes to These Terms

We may update the Terms as the product evolves or laws change. The “Last Updated” date will be revised and, where changes are material, we will provide additional notice (e.g., banner or email). Continued use of the Services after the update constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 14. Governing Law

Unless required otherwise by local law, these Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts located in [Your Jurisdiction].

## 15. Contact

Questions about these Terms can be directed to:

- **Email:** legal@totrmeme.online
- **Support form:** [Contact Us](/contact)

We aim to respond within two business days.
